Hi, my name is Toby Qin. I am a software engineer in testing and DevOps. I have worked in this field for more than 10 years, if you have good opportunities want to share, welcome to contact me via GitHub.

At spare time, I like to do a lot of things, reading, photography and coding. Have fun and hope you enjoy my blog.

你好，我是一名中国人，我的名字叫顺溜。我是一个犯了严重网瘾的人，脾气也不是很好，长期需要电击治疗。如果长时间没有电击我就会在深夜写代码，刷题目，做各种勾当。如果你不巧在网上遇到了我，请礼貌相待，一旦我发现你很不友好，我会顺着网线过来掐死你的。
